## Abstract
The project is a gas detection system using a gas sensor to detect a quantity of gas, in the beginning a green led is lit, as soon as it reaches the threshold, the system starts operating starting with the closing of the valve, an alarm is triggered, a red led is lit, the green one is tuned off and a fan will turn on. In order to view the gas rate instantly, we use a developed Android application that is used to display the recovered data by transmitting via a bluetooth module.
